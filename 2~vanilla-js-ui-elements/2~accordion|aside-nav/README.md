# Aside navigational menu, accordion, pseudo-components

> **‚ùó Attention:** Components from the `Example` folder project called pseudo-components because using that realization of components isn't being used on real projects; that's uncofortable in usage and hard to develop on bigger projects. This showed here only as an example.

## Task

1) Look at the project in the `Example` folder. There's an example of aside navigational menu, accordion (that creates in function in `Example/public/js/accordion.js` file). There's simple pseudo-components implementation in `Example/public/js/accordion.js` file. It's just text insertion in parent element innerHtml.
2) Make similar profile page with aside navigational pannel and accordion.

## Additional task*

1) You can separate every big or repetable block of HTML element code into components. The custom implementation of the `require()` function in the `Example/public/js/index.js` file helps you to separate components into separate files without connecting additional scripts.
